Software upgrades are important as they allow your store to stay secure and up-to-date with the latest features released. Hence make sure you upgrade your X-Cart store regularly.

X-Cart software code and modules are upgraded independently from each other to ensure the data safetiness and overall software stability. If anything goes wrong with the modules upgrade you can simply disable the modules in question not affecting the main store functioning.
