Order processing is one of the main and important activities in ecommerce business. 

All orders placed by customers in your X-Cart based store appear in the **Orders list** (**Orders** -> **Order list** section) in the admin area. Here the order processing starts.

{% note info %}
X-Cart also allows creating orders manually from the admin area if required. See {% link ""Operate as a User" Feature" ref_26UftgNS %} description for more details.
{% endnote %}

Before you proceed to orders processing you need to know the system of order and payment statuses:

*   {% link "X-Cart Payment Transaction Statuses" ref_7pBlny0J %}

When an order is processed you need to {% link "ship" ref_7tvT7GEK %} it and manage further as you may need to add notes, tracking number, process refunds or follow up with the customer.
