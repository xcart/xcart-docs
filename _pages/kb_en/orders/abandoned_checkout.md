Shopping cart abandonment is a covert cause of a huge number of lost sales. The sad fact is that not everyone who adds a product to their cart completes the checkout. There are a lot of reasons this could happen. This person may not have their credit card in front of them, perhaps he/she wants to look around a bit more before placing an order or even an order resulted in unexpected costs. While there are a lot of reasons why people leave mid-checkout, most often it's not because they are no longer interested in the product.

X-Cart offers two possible solutions to trace abandoned carts and follow-up with the customers who did not finished an order for some reason:

*  {% link "Abandoned Cart Reminder" ref_Mf6yeSBE %}
*  {% link "Not Finished Orders" ref_7dKyzAJ4 %}

Remember that if a customer does not enter their email address before they abandon the checkout, no customer account is created in your store and items in a customers cart at the time that they abandoned the checkout are not saved. Hence you can't send them an abandoned checkout notification.
