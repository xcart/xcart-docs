Why to use boring default 404 'Page not found' when you can change it to something more personal and inspiring?

A default page with a 404 'Page not found' error in X-Cart looks as follows:

![404.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1vY1kBkj/404.png)

Using the built-in {% link "Webmaster Mode" ref_2L6W3YMS %} facilities you can change the page text and layout, add images, gifs and videos to your liking.

To edit a 404 page:
1. Log in as an admin to the store Admin Area and open the customer storefront using the **'View storefront'** button located at the top of any page in the Admin Area 
  ![view-storefront.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1vY1kBkj/view-storefront.png)

2. Find a page with a 404 'Page not found error' in your X-Cart storefront (e.g. https://your_xcart_store_url/cart.php?target=blablabla)

3. Click on a **'Gear'** icon in the bottom left corner of the page to open the **Webmaster mode** tools.

4. To edit the error text open the **Labels Editor** tool, enable **Highlight labels** and edit the text as described in the [guide](https://kb.x-cart.com/look_and_feel/managing_texts_labels_in_your_store.html#editing-text-labels-via-webmaster-mode "Changing 404 "page not found"").
  ![404-labels.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1vY1kBkj/404-labels.png)
  Save changes when complete.

5. To change the page layout or add an image/gif/video open the **Template Editor** tool, enable the **Pick templates from page** option, locate the relevant .twig file as described in {% link "How to Use Template Editor" ref_1gdpZJ44 %} and add your changes to the template. 
  ![404-template.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1vY1kBkj/404-template.png)
  Save changes when complete. 

Also it's possible to change the default 404 page to a completely custom one. 

For an **Apache server** you'll need to:

* Create your custom 404 page in HTML (e.g. custom_404.html).

* Locate/create a .htaccess file in the X-Cart root directory of your server

* Add the following line to your .htaccess file
  
  ```
  ErrorDocument 404 /custom_404.html
  ```
  _where /custom404.html is the **full** path to the new custom 404 page that you’ve created._
  
* Check your work 
  
  Look for a page that does not exist on your website. You should get your custom 404 page that you specified in the .htaccess file.

For a **Nginx server** you'll need to:

* Create your custom 404 page in HTML (e.g. custom_404.html).

* Add a few lines (as provided below) into the [server {} section](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server "Changing 404 "page not found"") of your nginx configuration file (nginx.conf):
  
  ```
  server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;
  
        . . .
  
        error_page 404 /custom_404.html;
        location = /custom_404.html {
                root /usr/share/nginx/html;
                internal;
        }
  }
  ```
