They said "Good clothes open all doors" hence choosing a store theme is a serious task for an ecommerce business owner. A theme should not only be attractive but also appropriate and meet particular business needs. So don't hurry up and take your time to make a right decision.

X-Cart offers 5 free color schemes for your store out of the box and over [70 template add-ons](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Look and feel") that you can use if none of the free five suits you. With any theme you choose you'll get a stylish, responsive, fully customizable and well-suited solution. 

When the template choice is left behind check the standard structure overview and start with the simple skin manipulations essential for almost every store:

*   {% link "Managing Skins" ref_1yXxbHIW %}
*   {% link "Basic Skin Changes" ref_3vgykcgf %}
*   {% link "Managing images" ref_zyQIOcia %}


If you are ready to delve into the process and need to add custom changes to the skin layout e.g. to change the position of the blocks in drag and drop fashion, to apply additional styling with Custom CSS option, to customize JavaScript or to build unique email notifications templates, etc. use the Theme Tweaker facilities to make the changes on the fly.

Also it's possible to customize content and service pages as well as to change the store navigation to make your site look unique and professional.
