They said "Good clothes open all doors" hence choosing a store theme is a serious task for an ecommerce business owner. A theme should not only be attractive but also appropriate and meet particular business needs. So don't hurry up and take your time to make a right decision.

X-Cart offers 5 free color schemes for your store out of the box and over [70 template add-ons](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Look and feel") that you can use if none of the free five suits you. With any theme you choose you'll get a stylish, responsive, fully customizable and well-suited solution.

When the template choice is left behind start with simple skin manipulations essential for almost every store:

*   {% link "Changing your store's logo and favicon" ref_2VXSZhKE %}
*   {% link "Changing logo size for Crisp White skin" ref_RrLo9hcw %}
*   {% link "Changing the checkout logos picture" ref_V0WJ7Tzu %}
*   {% link "Changing your store's Welcome text and banner on the Front page" ref_Id69E4GT %}
*   {% link "Adding banners to store pages" ref_35tpPrVf %}

*   {% link "Enabling the Contact Us form" ref_hfZXkxzT %}
*   {% link "Editing the text on the Contact Us page" ref_CsqC5DNX %}

If you are ready to delve into the process and need to add custom changes to the store layout go further and use Theme Tweaker to edit your store’s look & feel easily — change the position of the blocks in drag and drop fashion or choose a pre-made layout type.
