After you choose a skin that defines the basic look and feel of your online store, you can customize it to suit your unique brand. 

The basic skin customizations include changing the default store logo and favicon as well as removing the welcome text and banner on the storefront. These items come with the default X-Cart skin and need to be removed or replaced with your own images and text so your store site has a professional appearance. X-Cart allows you to upload your own logo image to be displayed at the top of all the pages in your store. It not only serves as branding for your store site, but also links back to your store home page.

Sometimes it may also be necessary to change the default text on the store pages, as different people may prefer different words for the same meaning. This is also possible to help your store look unique. 

To make your store pages more attractive for customers, you can add banners to your store pages. Removing the "Powered by" notice may be usefull if you want to hide the information about the software platform you use from your competitors.
