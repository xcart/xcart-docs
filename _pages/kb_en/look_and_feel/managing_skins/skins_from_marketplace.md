[X-Cart Marketplace](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Uploading Skins from Marketplace") offers over 70 skin to your choice that you can obtain and use for your site.

The steps involved in installling a skin from the Marketplace are similar to the ones described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}. 

So to install a skin from the Marketplace you'll need to:

1. Open the **Layout** section of the admin area (**Look & Feel** -> **Layout**)
2. Click the **Activate purchased skin** button (if the skin is already paid):
   ![activate-license.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/activate-license.png)
3. Enter your license key into the appropriate field and click **Activate**: 
   ![enter-license-key.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/enter-license-key.png)
   
   * Provided that the submitted license key is valid, X-Cart will start downloading the skin:
     ![installing-updates.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/installing-updates.png)
     
     Once the new skin has been downloaded, it's added to the list of the skins available for installation in the **Choose a new template** section of the page.
   
4. Choose the skin from the list of available (the new skin is marked with blue, while the current one is marked with ogange) and click **Submit** to apply it to the storefront:
   ![submit-new-skin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/submit-new-skin.png)
   
   * The process is likely to take a few minutes. Take care not to close the page before the process has been fully completed.

     Once the skin installation has been completed, a confirmation message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

5. That is all. Your new skin has been installed.

In case you haven't purchased a skin as yet and need to choose one, use the Visit the template store link in the **Choose a new template** section of the **Layout** page (**Look & Feel** -> **Layout**):
![visit-template-store.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/visit-template-store.png)

You'll be redirected to X-Cart Marketplace where you can find and purchase a skin you like.
