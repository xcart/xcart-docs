{% note warning %}
The Standard skin is deprecated starting from X-Cart 5.4.0.x, 3 color schemes (Digital, Fashion and Noblesse) being removed completely. 

For early adopters of the Standard skin in color schemes other than Standard, the color scheme used in the store before v5.4.0.x will be preserved as-is during the upgrade. Beware that in case a deprecated color scheme is changed to any new skin in 5.4.x the changes can not be reverted. 
{% endnote %}

You can manange your store's design templates (skins) using the **Layout** section (**Look & Feel** > **Layout**) of the store Admin area.
![layout-section.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/layout-section.png)

If you visit this section, you will see that the upper part of the page shows the design template that is installed and active in the store currently. 
![current-skin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/current-skin.png)

You can use the **Customize storefront** button to access some storefront customization settings.

For some skins you may also be able to edit custom options:

If you wish you can switch to using a different skin.

All the skins available to you are shown in the **Choose a new template** section. The skin that is currently active in your store is highlighted with a green frame. To switch to a different skin, select the skin you require in the **Choose a new template** section (by clicking on the skin icon) and click the **Submit** button. 

You can purchase and download more skins from the X-Cart App Store. More info on this is available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

You can disable or remove a previously installed skin by deactivating or uninstalling the respective addon via the **My addons** section.
