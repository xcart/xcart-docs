Each X-Cart package (Business, Multivendor and Ultimate) comes with 5 pre-installed themes that a user can choose from. In case none of the default themes suits the business it's possible to purchase and download a paid skin from the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Managing Skins"). 

All skins, both default and paid ones, has a standard left-to-right representation. If necessary it's possible to convert a skin into a right-to-left one using a special {% link "RTL Languages Support" ref_3vEHzhPP %} addon.
