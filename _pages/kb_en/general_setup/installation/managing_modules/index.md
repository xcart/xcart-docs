The functionality of your X-Cart 5 based store can be extended by installing addons (modules). 

After installing X-Cart 5 you will find that your store already has some installed addons. You can view their list in the Installed Addons section (available via the **My addons** menu item in the Admin menu). You can enable/disable specific addons according to your needs.

It is possible to obtain and install more addons. A great selection of addons for X-Cart 5 is available via the X-Cart App Store; however, addons can also be obtained from other sources.
