## Activating Addons

Sometimes the addon you want to use is installed, but not active. To be able to use such an addon, you need to activate it. 

To activate an installed addon:

1.  In your store's Admin area, click **My addons** to go to the **My Addons** section:
    ![my_addons_link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/my_addons_link.png)

2.  In this section, find the addon that needs to be activated (for example, **Add to Cart Popup**):
    ![xc5_modules_add2cart_addon_in_mktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/xc5_modules_add2cart_addon_in_mktplce.png)

3.  Switch the On/Off trigger below the addon name to the "On" state:
    ![xc5_modules_add2cart_is_on.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/xc5_modules_add2cart_is_on.png)

4.  Click the **Apply changes** button at the bottom of the screen. 
    ![xc5_modules_savechanges_4_add2cart.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/xc5_modules_savechanges_4_add2cart.png)

This starts the addon activation process which may take a while to complete. Once your store has been redeployed, you will find the addon active and ready to use:
    ![addon_enabled.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/addon_enabled.png)
    

## Deactivating Addons

It is possible to temporarily disable (deactivate) an installed addon.

{% note info %}
Deactivation stops the addon from operation, but it does not remove the settings you made to the addon configuration nor clear any data that was generated or collected during the period that the addon was in operation. If you wish to completely remove all the data related to using a certain addon, you need to uninstall it.
{% endnote %}

To deactivate an installed addon:

1.  In the **My Addons** section of your store's Admin area, find the addon that needs to be deactivated.
2.  Switch the On/Off trigger below the addon name to the "Off" state.
    ![addon_deactivate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/addon_deactivate.png)

3.  Click **Apply changes**. This starts the addon deactivation process. Once your store has been redeployed, you will find the addon disabled.

## Uninstalling Addons

To uninstall (delete) addon you are not planning to use further use the **'Trash'** icon bellow the addon name and click **Apply changes**. 
![addon_delete.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_uEnDBBA7/addon_delete.png)

This starts the addon deinstallation process. Once your store has been redeployed, the addon will be removed from your store.

{% note info %}
It is recommended to uninstall any addons that you do not use to facilitate the overall store performance.
