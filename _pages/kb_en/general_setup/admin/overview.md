When you log in to your X-Cart Admin area, the first thing that you see is the Admin area Home page:

![first-stats-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/first-stats-page.png)

X-Cart Admin Home page shows information about orders awaiting processing, bestseller products and products low in stock, as well as your store’s recent sales stats and X-Cart community news. Right after the software installation, the Admin Home page also provides the {% link "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard" ref_5xTo5Gmg %} that is aimed to help a store admin with the initial store setup.

To return to the Home page from any other page of the Admin area, click on the store logo icon in the left of the header panel.

## Admin Header

The Admin area header shows the version of the X-Cart software being used and includes some tools for quick navigation and search through the store, as well as a tool to open or close the storefront for customers. These are accessible from any page of the store Admin area. In addition to that, the header shows the store's low-stock alerts, software update alerts and App Store notifications. It also gives access to the admin profile and X-Cart user docs which can be of help in the store setup and management.

### Notifications

Notifications of products running out of stock, as well as notifications of available X-Cart software updates and new addons available in the App Store can all be seen in the Admin area header. 

When a new alert comes up, the corresponding icon in the header is highlighed with an orange circle at the top. To see the notification, one needs to click on the icon and expand the menu.

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>X-Cart Store Alerts</i>![admin-alerts.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/admin-alerts.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>App Store Alerts</i>![marketplace-alerts.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/marketplace-alerts.png)</div>
</div>

### Navigation and Search Tools

The Admin area header can also be used for quick navigation and search throughout the store.

The navigation menu in the header allows a store admin to add a new product, category, user or discount coupon in about one click from any page of the Admin area. All they need to do is expand the quick navigation menu and click on the respective icon.

![quick-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/quick-menu.png)

The search bar in the header allows to quick-search through products, users and orders from any page of the Admin area. Just choose what you will be searching through in the dropdown and type a request in the search bar.

### Storefront Accessibility

A store admin can access the customer storefront and open/close it in one click directly from the header of the Admin area. 

To make the storefront open or closed for customers it's just necessary to switch the "View storefront" toggle ON/OFF.

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Storefront is open</i>![storefront-on.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/storefront-on.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Storefront is closed</i>![stofront-off.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/stofront-off.png)</div>
</div>

To access the customer storefront a store admin should only click the link next to the toggle and it will be opened in a new browser tab. The store admin will be able to view the storefront working even if it is closed, as it will be opened with a special activation ShopKey. To see the storefront just as it looks for customers a store admin will need to log out or open the customer storefront in an incognito mode. 

### Admin Account and Help Docs

To edit your personal admin account open the dropdown menu under the Admin icon in the right of the header and click 'My profile'.

![my-profile.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/my-profile.png)

Also using this dropdown a store admin can access the X-Cart Knowledge Base and Dev Docs, suggest an idea on the software improvement or report a software bug as well as contact X-Cart using the 'Contact Us' at [www.x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html "Admin Area Overview").

![info-panel.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/info-panel.png)

The 'Orders awaiting processing' board shows the info on the last 5 orders placed in your store. The same does the 'Low inventory products' board below it, it shows the latest 5 products with least inventory. A store admin can proceed to processing any of the orders or changing the product properties by clicking the target order number or product name directly on the dashboard and will be automatically redirected to the required page of the Admin area.

As for the 'Bestsellers' tab the store admin can set it up to display either all products or the only available products and choose the period (from 24 hours to lifetime) the stats data should be counted for:
