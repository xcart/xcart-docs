The functionality of your X-Cart 5 based store can be extended by installing additional modules: add-ons. 

After installing X-Cart 5 you will find that your store already has some installed addons. You can view their list in the Installed Addons section (available via the **My addons** menu item in the Admin menu). You can enable/disable specific addons according to your needs. See {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

It is possible to obtain and install more addons. A great selection of addons for X-Cart 5 is available via X-Cart's Marketplace; however, addons can also be obtained from other sources. To install a new addon, please use the guidelines outlined in the following articles: 

*   {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} (Use for addons obtained via X-Cart's Marketplace);
*   {% link "Uploading addons" ref_GZQ9vTq6 %} (Use for addons obtained elsewhere).
