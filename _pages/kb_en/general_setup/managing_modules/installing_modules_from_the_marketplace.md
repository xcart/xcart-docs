To install an addon from the X-Cart Marketplace:

1.  Log in to your store's Admin area and go to the **Addons Marketplace**:

    Click **My addons** in the Admin menu.
    ![xc5_modules_my_addons_link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Vn1mMUw9/xc5_modules_my_addons_link.png)
    
    Then click on the "View more addons in Marketplace" link to go to the **Addons Marketplace**.
    ![xc5_modules_goto_addons_mktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Vn1mMUw9/xc5_modules_goto_addons_mktplce.png)

    Your store will connect to the X-Cart Marketplace to obtain the list of addons available there. You should see a page like the following:
    ![xc5_modules_addons_mktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Vn1mMUw9/xc5_modules_addons_mktplce.png)

2.  In the list of addons, locate the addon you require (The filters at the top of the addon list can help you do it faster):
    ![xc5_modules_mktplce_filtering.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Vn1mMUw9/xc5_modules_mktplce_filtering.png)
     
    Any addons that are already installed in your store will be marked "**Installed**" in the Marketplace. Other addons will have either the **Install** or **Purchase** button next to their name. The addons with the **Install** button are the ones that can be installed for free. The addons with the **Purchase** button are commercial modules that require purchasing a license. 
    ![xc5_modules_purchase_install_installed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Vn1mMUw9/xc5_modules_purchase_install_installed.png)
    
3.  Depending on whether your chosen addon is free or commercial, use one of the following methods:

    _Free modules_: 
    Select the addon for installation by clicking **Install** below to the addon name (It is possible to select more than one module on the page).
    Click the **Install addons** button at the bottom of the screen. This starts the installation process. 

    _Commercial modules_: 
    Click the** Purchase** button next to the addon name to purchase the addon license. 
    After the license has been paid for, you will get an email message with your license key. The subject of this message is '**Your** "**Addon name**" **addon key**'. (The part "Addon name" should be replaced with the actual name of the addon). 
    Use this key to {% link "activate your addon license" ref_qwhmJtqW#activating-an-x-cart-5-addon-license %}. As soon as the license has been activated, the addon will be automatically installed at your store.

4.  Once the addon is installed, you will be redirected to the **Recently istalled addons **page where a success message will be displayed at the top of the screen. You will find the newly installed addon listed on the page.

    Now if you choose to view the list of your store's installed addons, the addon you have installed will be on the list. 

   {% note info %}
   After the addon has been installed, it is already in the _Enabled_ (active) state. You can temporarily disable the addon or remove it completely using the addon deactivation instructions from the article {% link "Activating and Deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.
   {% endnote %}
