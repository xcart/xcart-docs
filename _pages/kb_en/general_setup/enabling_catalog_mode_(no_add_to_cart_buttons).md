It is possible to remove all **Add to cart **buttons from your store and only show products to customers - without letting them buy anything. This can be done by {% link "installing" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} the module **Catalog** by X-Cart team:

Once the module has been installed, checkout is disabled, and store visitors are not allowed to buy any products.
