## Onboarding Wizard Welcome

First of all, the Quickstart Onboarding Wizard will welcome you and show all the steps you'll come through in setting up your store.

![quickstart-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-1.png)

These are the very basic steps required. 

You'll also have an option to skip the store configuration this time and postpone it for a later date, as well as to close the wizard so that it is no longer displayed on the Admin Home page.

If you decide to move on, click the **Let's set up your store!** button and proceed to the first step.
 
## Step 1 - Add Your First Product

The wizard suggest that you should start the store configuration with adding your first product. 

![quickstart-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-2.png)

If you are not ready to add a product right now, skip this step and go further. Your newly installed X-Cart store has a pack of demo products that you can use to test the basic store functionality.

You can add products later on and not necessarily manually one-by-one. Use the built-in {% link "Import-Export" ref_TANvG2De %} tool to add the whole product catalog at once.

If you decide to move on with adding your first product, you'll need to name it, set the product's price and upload a product image either from your local computer or via URL, just tap on the image area to see your options. 

This is how this step may look when all required product fields are filled in:

![quickstart-2-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-2-2.png)

If you want to configure extra product options, click the "Add other options" link and the wizard will open the {% link "product details page" ref_2D8wAeXP %} in a new browser tab.

When all the required fields are filled in click the **Save and go to the next step** button.

The wizard will suggest you taking a look at your new product in the store front. 

![quickstart-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-3.png)

Moreover, this page gives you an opportunity to delete all the demo products present in your store by far. You can do this if you are ready to populate the store with your own live products catalog. If not, keep the demo products a bit longer. You may need them to test the basic store functioning.

Click **Proceed to the next step** to go further.

## Step 2 - Upload Your Company Logo

On Step 2 you can upload your company logo that will be displayed on the top on all pages of the store. The store logo serves not only as branding for your site, but links back to your homepage.
![quickstart-4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-4.png)

The store logo can also be uploaded from your local computer or via URL. Tap on the logo area to see the options. 

The recommended logo size is 400x150 px, the recommended file formats are PNG. JPG and GIF.

Your store logo will be a part of your company style and will visualize your brand to the site visitors. So take this step seriously. If you don't have a good selling logo, just [ask](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html#design "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard") and we'll help you with it. 


## Step 3 - Set Up Your Store Locale and Company Info

On Step 3 you can configure geographic settings to connect your store with local customers and set your company info that will be used to form invoices, send email notifications and calculate shipping rates for your store.

Start with the store locale. It has the predefined country, currency and weight values based on the info the wizard get during the software installation. However, these values may not always be correct. So you need to verify and change the data if required.

![quickstart-5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-5.png)

If everything is correct click **Proceed to the next step** to move on with the company details info. 

If you need to go deep into the store localization click **More localization settings** and the wizard will open the Store setup -> Localization page in a new tab where {% link "more options" ref_cc4sCpa5 %} area available.

On the Company info page you'll need to fill in the company name and business address. This address will be used as an origin destination address for the store shipping setup.

![quickstart-6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-6.png)

Click **Save and go to the next step** when you are ready.

## Step 4 - Set Up Delivery Options

Step 4 of your store configuration is devoted to shipping. 

First of all here you'll need to choose whether you'll sell tangible goods that need shipping or whether these will be e-goods and services that are non-shippable. 

![quickstart-7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-7.png)

If you are selling e-good and services everything is prity simple. Click **Mark all products and non-shippable** and that's it! The wizard will set the [Requires shipping product option](https://kb.x-cart.com/products/products/managing_products/adding_products/basic_product_setup.html#shipping "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard") for all products in your store to NO and all shipping methods will automatically be disabled.

If you sell tangible goods, the process is a bit more complicated. You need to set up shipping options for them. For this purpose click the **Set up shipping** button.

You'll see a page where you can configure shipping rates for your store:

![quickstart-7-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-7-1.png)

On this page you can choose between shipping carriers with real-time shipping quotes and your own flat shipping rate that you can create directly on this page. Just choose the destination country and set the rate, then click the **Create shipping rate** button. This shipping method will become available at checkout. 

For a more detailed shipping setup click the **Advanced shipping options** button and the wizard will open the Store setup -> Shipping page of the Admin area in the new tab where you can {% link "move on further" ref_3TG6AuN0 %}. 

If you choose real-time shipping carriers, click on the carrier logo and you'll be redirected to the carrier service page to set up an account with them. 

When the shipping setup is over you can proceed to the last step of this wizard - payments setup.

## Step 5 - Set Up Payment Methods

Payment methods setup is the last but not the least step of the Quickstart Onboarding Wizard. 
![quickstart-8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-8.png)

X-Cart allows to choose whether you'll use one or more of over 120 integrated online payment systems or whether you will process payments offline by your own means. 

By default, off-line demo payment methods are pre-configured and enabled. They are quite enough to test your new X-Cart store functioning. So if that's the purpose, leave the present configuration settings as is and **Proceed to the next step** (complete the store setup with the wizard).

However, if you want to process real orders, you need to configure real payment methods that will work for your customers. Click the **Set up offline & online payments** button for the wizard to open the Store setup -> Payments page in a new tab. Configure payment methods for your store {% link "following the guides of this manual" ref_Jq6Bsdrt %}. 

Once the payments setup is complete, you are finished and can close the wizard.
