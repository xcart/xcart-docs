If necessary you can add a PDF version of invoices to the email notifications by enabling the setting **Send the PDF version of invoices in the attachments** on the **Attachments** tab of the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** page. 

![attachments.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_08i5p47o/attachments.png)

PDF invoices will be added as an attachment to all order related notifications.

{% note info %}
You can extend the default PDF invoices feature with a paid {% link "PDF Invoices" ref_4pIx0x0g %} addon that is more flexible and powerful.
{% endnote %}
