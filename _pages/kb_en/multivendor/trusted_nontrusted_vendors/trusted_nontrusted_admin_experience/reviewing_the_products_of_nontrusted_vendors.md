After a non-trusted vendor submits a new product for approval by the store administrator, the store administrator is notified about the fact via a bell notification:
![tnt_bell_unapproved_products.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/tnt_bell_unapproved_products.png)
(The words "Unapproved products N" are a link which the store administrator can use to quickly access the list of products sent for approval; N is the number of products for review.)

The store administrator can use the "Unapproved products N" link in the bell notification or go to the Products section and {% link "use filtering" ref_3ge43cA0 %} to find the products in the "Sent for approval" state.

To approve or decline the publication of a product, the store administrator needs to open the product for viewing/editing; then they need to use the Approve or the Decline button according to what action they require.

If the administrator chooses to approve the publication of the product, a popup titled "Approve and add comment" will be displayed:
![tnt_approve_add_comment.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/tnt_approve_add_comment.png)

To approve the publication of the product, the store administrator will need to click the **Approve product** button. Leaving a comment for the vendor is optional. 

If the administrator chooses to decline the publication of the product, a popup titled "Decline and add comment" will be displayed:
![tnt_decline_add_comment.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/tnt_decline_add_comment.png)

To decline the publication of the product, the store administrator will need to click the **Decline product** button. Leaving a comment for the vendor is optional. 

Approving or declining the publication of a product triggers an {% link "email notification" ref_2x7CPLIC %} to the vendor to notify them of the product status change. If the administrator has chosen to leave a comment, the comment is sent to the vendor along with the email notification.
