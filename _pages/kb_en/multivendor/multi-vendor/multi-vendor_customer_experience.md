In a multi-vendor X-Cart 5 store, the storefront provides a **Vendors** menu from which store visitors can access the profile and products of specific vendors:

Note that the **Vendors** menu appears on the storefront only if the store administrator has chosen to make this menu available in the sidebar of the store site. 

By clicking on the vendor company name link on the **Vendors** menu, store visitors can access the vendor's profile page. This page provides general information about the vendor including their company name, image, description and location. It also lists all the vendor's products:

The details pages of specific products also provide some information about the vendor. This includes the vendor's company name, location and image. There is also the View Profile link that allows visitors to access the vendor's profile page:

If the store administrator has chosen to enable product filtering by vendor with the help of X-Cart 5 **Product Filters** module, visitors of the store's Customer area can filter products by vendor in catgories that list products of more than one vendor:

When a product owned by a vendor is added to the shopping cart, the vendor's company name appears on the cart page:

If the cart contains products of more than one vendors, the products on the shopping cart page are automatically sorted by vendor:

In the "Warehouse" multivendor mode, the list of shipping methods available for the order is formed by the store administrator; the buyer has to choose a single shipping method for the entire order. In the "Vendors as separate shops" mode, each vendor has their own list of shipping methods; the buyer has to choose a shipping method for each of the vendors whose products are in the shopping cart:

In the "Warehouse" multivendor mode, the buyer gets a single order invoice. In the "Vendors as separate shops" mode, a separate order is formed for each of the vendors whose products are in the order; the buyer gets a separate order invoice for each of the orders.
