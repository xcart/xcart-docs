In a multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors** installed and enabled, a new type of X-Cart store users is added: vendor staff members. Users of this type are added by existing vendors to enable access of their own staff members or business partners to the dedicated area of the store in which they work on their products and orders. 

This section discusses the user experience of vendor staff members:
   
   * How a new user becomes a registered vendor staff member.
      See {% link "Multiple Profiles for Vendors: Becoming a Vendor Staff Member" ref_06GsE5l1 %}
  
   * What resources will be available to a vendor staff member after registration.
      See {% link "Multiple Profiles for Vendors: Staff Member Access Levels" ref_2RWVrO1D %}
