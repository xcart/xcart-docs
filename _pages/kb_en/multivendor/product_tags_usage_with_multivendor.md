In a Multivendor X-Cart store with the addon {% link "Product Tags" ref_6nFoxYf1 %} installed and enabled, it is possible to use product tags. The addon enables the store staff (administrator, vendors) to attach custom tags to products so shoppers can find them easier.

## Product Tags: Multivendor Store Administrator Experience
The store administrator configures the addon settings and determines, to which extent vendor users should be able to manage product tags.

The addon settings page provides the setting **Allow vendors to create new tags**. By default it is disabled, which means that product tags can be added, edited and deleted only by the store administrator, whereas vendors can only use the already existing tags created for them by the administrator. If the administrator chooses to enable the **Allow vendors to create new tags** option, vendors will have full product tag management capabilities: they will be able to add their own tags for products, as well as edit and delete any existing tags (including the ones created by the other users). 


The store administrator can view and manage all the product tags in the store via the Tags section (**Catalog** > **Tags**) in the Admin area. They can also assign existing tags to their own products and to the products of any vendor, should a vendor request their assistance. For more info on how to manage product tags as an administrator, see the {% link "Product Tags" ref_6nFoxYf1 %} manual.

## Product Tags: Vendor Experience
Depending on the store settings, vendors will have either limited or full product tag management capabilities. 

Limited product tag management capabilities mean that vendors cannot create new product tags or edit/delete the existing ones, but they can assign tags created by the store administrator to their own products via the **Tags** field on the Info tab of product details and to search for products by tags. 

Full product tag management capabilities mean that vendors have a Tags section in their Vendor area (**Catalog** > **Tags**) - similar to the one used by the administrator.

Via this section, they can add their own tags for products, as well as edit and delete any existing tags (including the ones created by other users). They can assign tags to their own products via the **Tags** field on the Info tab of product details (using tags created by themselves or by any other users) or and to search for products by tags.
