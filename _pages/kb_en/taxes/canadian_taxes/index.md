Canada has [three types of sales tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_Canada "Canadian Taxes"):
1. Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
2. Provincial sales taxes (PST)
3. Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)

The GST is a federal value-added tax with a fixed rate of 5%, as of January 2019. The Canadian government levies the GST on sales in Canada of most tangible property and of services. 

The PST is collected in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba (Retail Sales Tax or RST) and Quebec (Quebec Sales Tax or QST). In all provinces where the provincial sales tax is collected, the tax is imposed on the sale price without GST.

The HST is collected in five of the ten Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island. In HST provinces, the HST includes the GST and a provincial portion of tax. This tax is charged as one tax, and isn't broken into federal and provincial portions.

The three territories of Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut) do not have territorial sales taxes and collect the GST only.
