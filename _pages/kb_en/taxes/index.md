Sales tax calculation in X-Cart 5 can be enabled using the module **Sales Tax**. Typically you will find this module already installed in your store. (If this is not the case, you can install it any time from X-Cart's Marketplace following the {% link "standard module installation procedure" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.) 

If the installed module is not enabled, you will need to {% link "activate" ref_uEnDBBA7 %} it.

Setting up sales tax in X-Cart 5 is not difficult, whereas the system provides enough flexibility to configure even the most intricate tax calculation rules: if necessary, it is possible to configure your sales tax so it is calculated differently depending on the tax class of the products in the order, the customer's address zone and the customer's membership level.
