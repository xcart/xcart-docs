As a merchant, you might need to charge taxes on your sales, and then report and remit those taxes to your government. X-Cart allows to configure taxes both manually and automatically and charge your customers the tax but it doesn’t file or remit your taxes for you. You might need to register your business with your local or federal tax authority to handle your taxes. You should always check with a local tax authority or a tax accountant to make sure that you charge your customers the correct tax rates, and to make sure you file and remit the taxes correctly.

In X-Cart you can set taxes up manually by defining tax rates for areas you are required to collect sales tax. Taxation will be applied at checkout based on the customer's billing or shipping address. For US based stores taxes need to be configured for the states that a merchant's business has nexus in. For stores based outside the United States, taxes need to be set according to local tax requirements.

For merchants based in the US, Canada and the EU there is an option to set up automated tax calculation with a free {% link "AvaTax" ref_6880bVvi %} integration. Merchants from the US can also use the {% link "TaxJar" ref_0wHdWryq %} integration to automate tax calculcation.
 
You can also set up tax overrides to address unique tax laws and situations using X-Cart tax classes.
