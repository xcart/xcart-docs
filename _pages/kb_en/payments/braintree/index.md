An X-Cart store can be integrated with [Braintree, A PayPal Service](https://www.braintreepayments.com/). Currently, there are two Braintree integration addons available in the X-Cart Marketplace:
   
   * **[PayPal powered by Braintree](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal-powered-by-braintree.html)** 
   * **[Braintree payment gateway](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/braintree-for-xcart5.html)**

The addons use different APIs and different accounts, and provide different sets of features. The two addons may not be used simultaneously, so you will need to choose one solution.

The addon "Braintree payment gateway" was historically our first Braintree integration based on an earlier version of Braintree API. This Braintree integration features a payment card entry form displayed via an iframe. Due to this, not much can be done to customize the form. However, this type of integration supports Apple Pay, Google Pay, Paypal Credit and Venmo.

The addon "PayPal powered by Braintree" is the newer of the two. It is the most advanced payment solution from PayPal to date, and it is based on the latest Braintree API. The payment card entry form in this type of integration is generated by the store, which provides quite a number of options for customization. At the time of writing this article, "PayPal powered by Braintree" does not support Apple Pay and the other above-listed solutions that are available for "Braintree payment gateway".

Both the APIs are available to users in the USA, UK, France, Italy and Spain. The API used by the addon "Braintree payment gateway" is also available in some other countries. 

Depending on the X-Cart version you are using, a Braintree integration addon may already be installed in your X-Cart store:

If not, you can obtain it from the X-Cart Marketplace at any time:
![xc5_braintree_module.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3U96LOWn/xc5_braintree_module.png)

To accept payments with Braintree, you will need a Braintree or PayPal account. If you do not yet have one, you will be able to sign up in the process of setting up the Braintree integration for your store.
