Creating a custom payment page allows you to co-brand the PayPal checkout pages with your logo and colors. For that:

1.  Log in to your [PayPal account](https://www.paypal.com/).

2.  Underneath the **My Account** tab, click **Profile**;

3.  Click **My selling tools**;

4.  Locate **Custom payment pages**, and click the **Update** link next to it;

5.  Click **Add**;

6.  In the **Page Style Name** box, give a name to your custom page style. (It doesn't matter what you put here, as long as it isn't "PayPal".);

7.  In the **Logo Image URL** box, enter the URL of your logo image. Your logo image should be 190x60px, and should be hosted on an SSL-secured (https://) site. If you do not have an SSL-secured site available to you, free alternatives (such as sslpic.com) are available.

8.  In the **Cart Area Gradient Color** box, enter an HTML hex code that represents the gradient color you want to use around the shopping cart section of the checkout page.

9.  Click **Save**.

10.  Click the radio button next to the new payment page style you just created, and click **Make Primary**. Your custom payment page style will now be used whenever buyers choose to pay with PayPal.
