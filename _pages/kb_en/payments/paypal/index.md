An X-Cart 5 online store can be configured to accept payments with PayPal. Depending on the type of PayPal solution you require, you will need to use one of the following solutions: 

* **[PayPal](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal.html "PayPal")** addon for X-Cart by X-Cart team. This solution can be used to enable payments via:

   *   {% link "PayPal Express Checkout" ref_vHffMFLk %}
   *   {% link "PayPal Payments Standard" ref_DT2EX6fz %}
   *   {% link "PayPal Payments Advanced" ref_sO5X6iBT %}
   *   {% link "PayPal Payflow Link" ref_mTCkpViN %}
   *   {% link "PayPal for Marketplaces" ref_6iphJijP %} (supports multiple payment recipients; is recommended for X-Cart Multivendor PayPal Adaptive Payments)
   *   {% link "PayPal Adaptive payments" ref_FdXWLwVN %} (legacy)
   *   {% link "PayPal Partner Hosted with PCI Compliance" ref_0gaUolue %}
   *   {% link "PayPal Credit" ref_46r2geWj %}
   
   More information is available in the section {% link "PayPal addon" ref_0mnK3aMh %} of this manual.

* **[X-Payments](https://www.x-payments.com/ "PayPal")** (a payments platform by a PCI Level 1 certified service provider; X-Cart addon **X-Payments connector** is required to connect). This solution can be used to enable payments via:

   *   {% link "PayPal Payments Pro" ref_6k1NvzJp %} (Payflow API / PayPal API)
   *   PayPal Payflow Pro

* **[PayPal Here](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/PayPal-Here-payment-module.html "PayPal")** addon for X-Cart by Qualiteam. This addon and a mobile device with the PayPal Here application installed are required to use the PayPal Here solution by PayPal. For better interaction we also recommend to install the [Mobile Admin](https://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons/mobile-admin.html "PayPal") extension.
