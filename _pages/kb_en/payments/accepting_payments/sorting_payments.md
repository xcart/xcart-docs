Using the **Sorting & Descriptions** tab of the **Payment methods** section it's possible to set the payments order of appearance on the storefront and provide titles and descriptions for your payment methods.

By default all **Online methods** come first, but you can change the payments order if required by drag-n-dropping them to the right position. 

Also you can add the payment description and/or change the payment name that will be displayed to customers. Don't forget to **Save changes** when done.
