To be able to successfully install and use the AvaTax Sales Tax Automation addon, you need a working copy of X-Cart 5 installed on your server.

The addon can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace.

 For general addon installation instructions, see {% link "Installing Addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

As a result, you should have the addon "AvaTax Sales Tax Automation" listed in your store's Installed Addons section:
