  Once installed the module will become available in the **Sales Channels** > **Facebook E-Commerce** section of the store admin area. Also, each product will gain an _Add to Facebook product feed_ setting in the Marketing section on the product details page that is enabled by default. All products with the enabled _Add to Facebook product feed_ setting will be automatically added to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog.

2. Configure the module on the **Sales Channels** > **Facebook E-Commerce** section of the store admin area
