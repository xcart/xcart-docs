X-Cart's Amazon Pay module provides an integration with Amazon Pay, a payment service that enables buyers to pay on your online store using the payment and shipping information already stored in their existing Amazon accounts. All the interaction of buyers with Amazon Pay takes place in embedded widgets so that the buyers can complete the checkout process without ever leaving your website.
