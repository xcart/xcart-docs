The module enables you to sell digitally distributed content also known as e-goods. You can sell both e-goods and tangible products in one online store.

The module extends the [**File Attachments**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html "E-goods") module's functionality and allows you to specify whether a file uploaded for a product can be freely downloaded from the product page, or can be downloaded after the product is purchased only. When customers buy e-goods they receive an e-mail with the download links and see the links in their shop account.
