When an order is shipped via ShippingEasy, ShippingEasy notifies your X-Cart store about it, and the status of the order in your X-Cart store is automatically updated:

*   the fulfilment status of the order in X-Cart becomes "Shipped" (for orders shipped in full) or "Processing" (for partially shipped orders);
*   the payment status of the order in X-Cart becomes "Paid" (In most cases, the order will have the status "Paid" already assigned by this time).
