The addon [**Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/uk-vat.html) should be used for tax setup when it's necessary to charge customers a value added tax (VAT) or a goods and services tax (GST).

This addon is designed specially for businesses in the UK, EU, Australia and other countries where an ability to charge VAT / GST is a must. The addon allows you to use different tax rates based on the membership level and address of the customer. It also supports tax exemption based on customer's VAT ID.

Note that we have a special addon for {% link "Canadian taxes" ref_hxmof6xX %}.
