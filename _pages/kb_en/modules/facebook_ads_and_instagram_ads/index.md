Social feeds are a good point to attract new visitors and boost sales, Facebook Marketing being one of the most popular and efficient. If you have a Facebook account, you can start using X-Cart's free [Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/facebook-e-commerce.html) addon (formerly known as "Facebook eCommerce") right away. 

This addon enables you to upload your products to Facebook Catalog and to create personalized ads in both Facebook and Instgram that will allow reaching the right audience in the right place at the right time.

Once the products are added to the Facebook Catalog you can bind your Instagram business account to it and start selling goods in Instagram.
