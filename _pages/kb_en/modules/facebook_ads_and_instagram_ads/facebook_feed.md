## Product Feed Generation

Once the addon is {% link "set up" ref_7fTH58sR %} you can proceed to the product feed generation.

The Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon adds a new setting - **Add to Facebook product feed** - to each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the **Marketing** section of the product details page.

This setting is enabled by default, that means that all the products with the setting **Add to Facebook product feed** enabled will be added to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog automatically. If you want to exclude any of the products from being added to your Facebook feed make sure you disable the **Add to Facebook product feed** setting for this product beforehand.
  
To generate a feed:

1. Open the Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads settings page in your store's Admin area: **Marketing** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads** (in X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier the section name is **Sales Channels**) and click the **Generate Product Feed** button to get a link for uploading the product feed to your Facebook Catalog.

     <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier</b>![generate-feed-new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/generate-feed-new.png)</div>
     <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart 5.4.x</b>![540-generate-feed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1LQyHRCO/540-generate-feed.png)</div>
   </div>
   
   {% note info %}
   Use the {% link "Google Product Feed" ref_2gQBB6qM %} addon to expand the data values that are submitted to the feed. In case the Google Product Feed addon is installed and enabled and the hidden/global/class attributes are assigned to Google groups, the feed generated by the Facebook Adds & Instagram Ads addon will also include the hidden/global/class attribute values set up for the Google Product feed.
   {% endnote %}
   
   The system will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. 

2. Once the process is completed, copy the _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it into the appropriate field when specifying a source of products for your [catalog](https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new "Product Feed Generation and Upload to Facebook").

   The _Frequency of Product Feed renewal_ setting itself will not make renewals automatical. You will need to {% link "configure your server to run scheduled X-Cart tasks" ref_lLqNzAaq %}.
