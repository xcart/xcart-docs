Sometimes it may be necessary to enhance the regular product description with a file attachment to provide your customers with a manual (that is, for example, if you are selling household appliances) or with a detailed program description (for example, if you are selling educational courses, etc.)

You can do that using the addon [File attachments](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html). 
![xc5_fa_addon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/xc5_fa_addon.png)

The addon provides a special tab on the product page in the store back end -  "Attachments" - which enables you to attach files to the product. You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or from a URL. The maximum file size is limited by the server settings.

On the storefront, your store visitors can see and download the attachments from the product page:

## Adding Product Attachments

To add an attachment for a product:

1. Find the product for which you need to add an attachment and open its details.

2. Go to the **Attachments** tab. 
   ![xc5_fa_attachments_tab.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/xc5_fa_attachments_tab.png)

3. Click **Add file** and choose the file source:
   ![xc5_fa_add_file.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/xc5_fa_add_file.png)

   You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or via an external URL. 

4. Choose the file and click **Upload**.  Once the file has been uploaded to the X-Cart server, it will be added to the list of attachments for the product:
   ![xc5_fa_attachment_added.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/xc5_fa_attachment_added.png)

   If necessary, you will be able to delete or change the attachment file at any time later.

5. Adjust the attachment settings as you require. See [Managing Product Attachments](#managing-product-attachments). Be sure to save your changes.

## Managing Product Attachments

Attachments associated with a downloadable product can be managed via the Attachments tab of the product details:
   ![xc5_fa_manage_attachments.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/xc5_fa_manage_attachments.png)

   * Add more than one attachment for a single product: To add another attachment, use the **Add file** button.
   
   * Change the title and description of your attachment: Click anywhere within the respective fields, and they will become editable.
   
   * Change the attachment file (or the location of the file): Use the **[...]** button to access the respective menu.
     
   * Delete the attachment using the Delete ("Trash") button.
   
   * Use the Download ("down arrow") button to download the attachment file.
   
   * Use the Membership dropdown box to specify the membership-based group of customers who should be able to access the file.
   
   * Drag-n-drop attachments to change the order in which they are shown on the page.
   
   * Be sure to click **Save changes** to save any changes of the attachment details you have made.

## Cloning Products with File Attachments
When you clone a product with file attachments, the contents of the Attachments tab of the product from which a clone is created is copied to the clone product. As a result, you get two products using the same file attachment(s). If necessary, you can then edit the file attachments for the clone product (replace the files, adjust the _Free_ / _Paid_ access settings, adjust the availability of the files to different membership levels, and the like), or just keep the original files and their settings if you wish to re-use them. For information on product cloning, see the section {% link "Cloning Products" ref_5gTzBmtP %}.
