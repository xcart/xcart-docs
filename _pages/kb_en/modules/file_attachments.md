Sometimes it may be necessary to enhance the regular product description with a file attachment to provide your customers with a manual (that is, for example, if you are selling household appliances) or with a detailed program description (for example, if you are selling educational courses, etc.)

You can do that using the addon [File attachments](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html). 

The addon adds a special tab on the product page in the store back end -  "Attachments" - which enables you to attach files to the product; your store visitors can then download these files from the product page.

You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or from a URL. The maximum file size is limited by the server settings.

## Adding Product Attachments

To add an attachment for a product:

1. Find the product for which you need to add an attachment and open its details.

2. Go to the **Attachments** tab. 
   ![att-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/att-1.png)

3. Click **Add file** and choose the file source:
   ![att-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/att-2.png)
   You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or via an external URL. 

4. Choose the file and click **Upload**.  Once the file has been uploaded to the X-Cart server, it will be added to the list of attachments for the product:
   ![att-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/att-3.png)
   If necessary, you will be able to delete or change the attachment file at any time later.

5. Adjust the attachment settings as you require. See [Managing Downloadable Product Attachments](#managing-downloadable-product-attachments)

6. Save the changes.

## Managing Product Attachments

Attachments associated with a downloadable product can be managed via the Attachments tab of the product details:

   * Add more than one attachment for a single product: To add another attachment, use the **Add file** button.
   
   * Change the title and description of your attachment: Click anywhere within the respective fields, and they will become editable.
   
   * Change the attachment file (or the location of the file): Use the **[...]** button to access the respective menu.
     
   * Delete the attachment using the Delete ("Trash") button.
   
   * Use the Download ("down arrow") button to download the attachment file.
   
   * Use the Membership dropdown box to specify the membership-based group of customers who should be able to access the file.
   
   * Drag-n-drop attachments to change the order in which they are shown on the page.
   
   * Be sure to click **Save changes** to save any changes of the attachment details you have made.
