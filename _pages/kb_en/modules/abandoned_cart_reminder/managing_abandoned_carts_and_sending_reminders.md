This page provides information on the following actions with abandoned carts:

*   [Viewing/filtering the abandoned carts list](#viewingfiltering-the-abandoned-carts-list);
*   [Sending reminders](#sending-reminders);
*   [Deleting abandoned carts](#deleting-abandoned-carts).

## Viewing/filtering the abandoned carts list

When a cart becomes abandoned, it is added to your store's abandoned carts list.

To view the abandoned carts list:

*   In your store's Admin area, go to the Abandoned carts page (**Orders** > **Abandoned carts**). If your store has any abandoned carts, you will see them listed here.

The Abandoned carts page allows you to filter the list by an e-mail substring and/or a date range:

The list of abandoned carts is presented in the form of a table. For each cart on the list, the following information is provided:

*   **Email**: The email address of the abandoned cart owner.
*   **Products**: Information about the products contained in the abandoned cart (product names, quantities, selected options).
*   **Subtotal**: Subtotal amount of the abandoned order.
*   **Coupons**: (_This column is displayed only when Abandoned Cart Reminder is used in conjunction with the Coupons addon_) The coupon codes that were generated for the abandoned cart.
*   **Date**: Since when the cart has been in the abandoned state.
*   **Notified**: Whether any abandoned cart reminder emails have been sent to the cart owner and how many times (+ the date when a reminder email was last sent for the cart).

## Sending reminders 

If a reminder needs to be sent not to all, but just some of the abandoned carts on your store's abandoned carts list, you must send it manually.

To send a reminder email to owners of specific carts:

1.  In the [Viewing/filtering the abandoned carts list](#viewingfiltering-the-abandoned-carts-list), locate the carts for which you wish to send the reminder message and select them by selecting the respective check boxes in the first column. The **Remind selected** **customers** button below the list becomes active:

2.  Click **Remind selected** **customers**. A popup titled **Choose reminder** appears:

3.  In the popup, use the **Reminder** drop-down box to select the reminder message you wish to send and click **Send reminder**. The reminder message will be sent to the owners of all selected carts.

## Deleting abandoned carts

When you no longer need an abandoned cart to be stored, you can delete it.

To deleted an abandoned cart:

1.  In the [Viewing/filtering the abandoned carts list](#viewingfiltering-the-abandoned-carts-list), find the abandoned cart you wish to delete and select it by selecting the respective check box in the first column.
