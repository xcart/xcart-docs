After the addon "Auction in X-Cart 5" has been installed and enabled, it needs to be configured.

To configure the addon:

1.  In the Installed Addons section of your X-Cart store’s Admin area (**My addons**), locate the entry for "Auction in X-Cart 5" and click the **Settings **link below it:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225032/8356073.png)
    This opens the '"Auction in X-Crat 5" addon settings' page:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225032/8356011.png)
2.  On the Classic auction tab, adjust the addon settings:
    *   **Display the “Products on auction” block in the storefront**: This setting allows you to specify whether you want to showcase your auctioned products in a special block displayed on your store's home page and category pages - in addition to the Auction section of your site available via the "Auction"  link in the main menu.
        When enabled, the block is displayed either in a side box:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225032/8356074.png)
        or in the main column of your site:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225032/8356075.png)
        (The actual location depends on the value of the setting 'Display the "Product on auction" block in (a side box/the main column)'.)

        When the setting 'Display the "Products on auction" block in the storefront' is disabled, the block with auctioned products does not appear on the storefront.

    *   **The maximum number of products to be displayed in the “Products on auction” block**: This setting applies only if the "Products on auction" block is enabled. It allows you to specify the maximum number of auction listings that may be displayed in this block. For example, if you set this value to "2", the "Auction" block in your store will look similar to this:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225032/8356076.png)
        (In the screenshot above, the "Auction"  block displays only two listings: the ones for Acrobots and Bare Metal Bender Wind-up; the rest of the auction listings can be accessed by clicking on the "All products" link at the bottom of the block).

        If you set "The maximum number of products to be displayed in the “Products on auction” block" to "0" (zero), the block will include all your store's auction listings, both active and sold (awaiting payment).

    *   **Display the “Products on auction” block in** (_a side box_ or _the main column)_**:** This setting applies if the "Products on auction" block is enabled. It determines where the "Products on auction" block is displayed in a side box or in the main column.

3.  Click **Submit** to save the changes.
