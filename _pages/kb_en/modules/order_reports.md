The addon [Order Reports](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/order-reports.html "Order Reports Addon") helps merchants to analyze the sales return-on-investment by segmenting orders by products, categories, shipping country, etc. Hence it's possible to track where the most sales come from and get ideas about how to increase the revenue.

Once the addon has been {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}, it adds the **Order returns** section to the **Orders** parts of the Admin area (**Orders** -> **Order returns**):

To analyze statistics on the orders placed in the store a cart admin should open the **Orders** -> **Order returns** section and choose:
  
  * a required time period
  
  ![date-select.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_52nVzkWs/date-select.png)
  
  To set the required time period specify the date or date period in the **Choose date** field and click **Select**. _Today_/_This week_/_This month_/_etc._ shortcuts are also available.
  
  * a required orders segmentation (Total / Product / Category / Shipping country / Shipping state / Coupon / Top customers)
