If you want to be sure that any of your buyers has a registered profile in your store use the addon [Register on checkout](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/register-on-checkout.html "Register On Checkout").

To install the addon, follow the instructions from {% link "Installing Addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once installed, the addon automatically disables checkout from unauthorised customers and engages them to register at checkout.
