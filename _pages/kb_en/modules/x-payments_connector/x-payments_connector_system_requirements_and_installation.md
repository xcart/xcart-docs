Typically, your X-Cart 5 store will have the X-Payments connector installed and enabled from the very start:

![installed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_025khQBN/installed.png)

If not, you can install it from the X-Cart 5 Marketplace.

For instructions on how to configure the connection, see {% link "Connecting X-Cart 5 and X-Payments" ref_UFLdTRDQ %}.

**Important**: Please be aware that the X-Payments connector for X-Cart 5 has no support for the {% link "Not Finished Orders" ref_7dKyzAJ4 %} addon; for this reason, regardless of the addon settings, not finished orders will not be created when payment is made via X-Payments.
