The addon [Infinite Scroll](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/infinite-scroll.html "Infinite Scroll") by X-Cart allows to replace standard pagination with Facebook-wall-like infinite scrolling that improves shopping experience and makes product browsing easier and quicker not only on PCs but also on touchscreen devices like smartphones and tablets.

The addon Infinite Scroll is SEO friendly. Though pager does not appear on the page, it exists in the HTML code. This allows search engines to follow pager links and index the entire list of products.

To install the addon, follow the deneral guidelines from {% link "Installing Addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

After the addon has been installed and enabled, proceed to the addon settings page to configure the options:

The Infinite Scroll settings page allows to configure the following options:

![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1WLu7suL/settings-page.png)

* **Enable infinite scrolling on category pages** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the category listing page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Enable infinite scrolling in search results** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the search page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Enable infinite scrolling on brand pages** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the brand listing page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Show more products on scrolling automatically** : If this option is disabled more products are not displayed on the page as the customers scroll the page down. Instead the **Show More** button is displayed that a customer will need to click to see more products on the page.

**Submit** the settings to make them active.

That's it! The addon has been configured. Now your customers do not need to switch pages when looking through a long list of products. More products will be displayed automatically as they scroll the page down.
