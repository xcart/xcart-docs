The [Market Price](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/market-price.html "Market Price") addon allows setting a market product price, which shows the difference between the price offered in your store and the average price of the same product on the market. 

The addon is free and comes enabled with the default software installation:

If it is not, you can always enable it in the **My addons** section of the admin area as described in {% link "Activating and Deactivating Addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

When enabled the addon adds a **Market price** field to the _Price & Inventory_ section of the product details page in the admin area where the store admin can set the average market price on a product comparing to the price in this store:

The market price is meant to show a customer how advantageous it is to order the product in this store and is displayed next to the regular one in a category product list and on a product details pages. A sign showing the discount produced by the price difference is shown next to it to attract customer's attention.
