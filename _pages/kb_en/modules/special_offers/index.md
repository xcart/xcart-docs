Special offers is a great instrument to boost sales. If you haven't used it yet it's a good time to start. Unlike ordinary sales special offers encourage customers to spend more to get a discount.

X-Cart has two addons to offer you:
* Special Offers: Spend X Get Y [https://market.x-cart.com/addons/spend-x-get-y.html](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/spend-x-get-y.html "Special Offers")
* Special Offers: Buy X Get Y [https://market.x-cart.com/addons/buy-x-get-y.html](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/buy-x-get-y.html "Special Offers")

They differ in logic but both are aimed at increasing your sales. Let's check how you can use the addons to improve sales revenue:
- {% link "Special Offers: Buy X Get Y" ref_buy_x_get_y %}
- {% link "Special Offers: Spend X Get Y" ref_spend_x_get_y %}
