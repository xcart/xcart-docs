The X-Cart addon [Product Tags](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/product-tags.html "Product Tags") can be used to narrow down the search results either within the {% link "Product Filter Addon" ref_6e82A7rL %} or independently of it and hence can improve the overall customer experience. 

To start using the **Product Tags** addon, ensure that it is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_0fGEpvrh %} in the **My addons** section of the store's Admin area.

On the addon settings page, you can adjust the setting **Show tags list in the sidebar**. This setting specifies whether the **Tags** section should be displayed on the storefront or not. If enabled, product tags will be displayed in a separate section on every page of your store.

To add and manage product tags, go to the Tags section of your store's Admin area (**Catalog** -> **Tags**).

   ![tags.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6nFoxYf1/tags.png)

To add a product tag:
   1. Click **'New tag'**.
   2. In the blank field that appears, enter the tag name you require.
   3. Click **Save changes**. 

Once a tag is created, you can assign it to products. One product can have an unlimited number of tags assigned to it. 

To assign a tag to a product:

   1. Go to the Products section (**Catalog** -> **Products**).
   2. Find the product to which you need to assign the tag and open its details for editing.
   3. On the 'Info' tab of the product details, use the **Tags** field to select the tag(s) you require.

   4. Click **'Update product'** to save the changes.
  
If necessary, you can assign a product tag to more than one product at a time. For that you will need to use the **Bulk Editing** option:

   1. Go to the Products section (**Catalog** -> **Products**).
   2. Find the products to which you need to assign product tags. If you need to assign tags to all the products in the product list, select **Bulk edit all**; if you need to assign tags just to some of the products, select **Bulk edit selected**. Select the **'Categories and tags'** option.

   3. On the next page, specify the tags you require. You can add new tags or choose from the existing ones. It is also possible to remove or replace product tags for the products.

   4. Save the changes. The tags will be applied to all the selected products.
  
Once the tags have been configured and assigned to products, they can be used to narrow down the search results both in the store's back end and on the storefront.

To search for products by a tag in the Admin area, use one of the following methods:
   * In the Products section (**Catalog** > **Products**), expand the filter/search form above the product list, select the **Tag** checkbox in the search settings and enter the tag name.
   ![tag-search.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6nFoxYf1/tag-search.png)
   * In the Tags section (**Catalog** > **Tags**), find the tag you require and click on the number link displayed in the Products column of the tag list.
   
On the storefront, to find all the products with a certain tag, you will want to click on the tag in the **Tags** section. 
   ![front-end.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6nFoxYf1/front-end.png)

If, according to the store settings, product tags are not shown as a separate section in the Admin area, they are included into the block of {% link "Product Filters " ref_6e82A7rL %}, so you can use them there. The **Product Filters** section will display only the tags that are relevant for the category being viewed.
