title: Disable Drag'n'drop Add to Cart

The addon **[Disable drag'n'drop add to cart](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/disable-drag-n-drop.html "Disable drag'n'drop add to cart")** disables X-Cart's drag-n-drop add to cart feature, which is available by default.

The drag-n-drop add to cart feature enables a shopper to grab a product from a product listing and drag it to a drop location at the top right hand side of the screen (it says "Drop items here to shop"); when the hold on the product is released, the product is added to the shopping cart:

To disable the drag-n-drop add to cart feature, the addon simply needs to be installed and active.
![xc5_general_settings_disable_drag_n_drop.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2NVSkzc3/xc5_general_settings_disable_drag_n_drop.png)
No need to configure any addon settings - it is just the status of the addon that affects the add to cart behavior (addon enabled = drag-n-drop is not used; addon disabled = drag-n-drop is used).
