The **X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard** addon migrates data from X-Cart 4 based store to X-Cart 5. 

It migrates almost all X-Cart 4 data to X-Cart 5.
[The complete list of data being transferred.](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/migration/migration-from-xcart4-to-xcart5.html#what-data-is-migrated "XC4 to XC5 Migration Wizard")

It also performs the overall check of feature set in your X-Cart 4 and suggests what modules must be enabled in X-Cart 5 in order to match the functionality.

This way, after data transfer, you only need to adjust your store's look and feel, install missing addons and configure the settings that are not present in X-Cart 4.
