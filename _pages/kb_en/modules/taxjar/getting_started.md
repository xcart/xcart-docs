To enable TaxJar Sales Tax Automation at your X-Cart store, follow the steps below:

1. Get an account with [TaxJar](https://app.taxjar.com/sign_up "Getting started with TaxJar Sales Tax Automation") to get an API token. You will need to enter it on the ”TaxJar Sales Tax Automation” addon settings page in your X-Cart store.

2. Configure your company settings and tax profile in TaxJar.  
   
   You can get started by clicking ‘[Account](https://app.taxjar.com/account#states "Getting started with TaxJar Sales Tax Automation")’ on the navigation bar: 
   
   * Specify your company details in the [Business Profile](https://app.taxjar.com/account#basics "Getting started with TaxJar Sales Tax Automation") section. Keeping business profile up to date is important as TaxJar will use your address to determine tax rules in some cases. 
   * Add states with nexus in the [State Settings](https://app.taxjar.com/account#states "Getting started with TaxJar Sales Tax Automation") section (where your company needs to calculate sales and use tax due to “substantial physical presence” in a taxing jurisdiction)

3. Enable TaxJar Sales Tax Automation in your X-Cart store:
   
   * Make sure the TaxJar Sales Tax Automation addon is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.
   * Configure the addon (See {% link "Configuring the TaxJar Sales Tax Automation Addon" ref_3aEqWYoS %}).
