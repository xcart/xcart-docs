In case you are an existing X-Cart v4 (aka XC4) store based owner and want to upgrade it to X-Cart v5 (aka XC5) you can do it using a special [X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html). This wizard is aimed at helping a store owner to migrate data from an XC4 based store to XC5. Besides that it will be necessary to {% link "install a fresh X-Cart 5 store" ref_VG5mIoLT %} beforhand and re-implement any possible custom features manually afterwards. 

Basically, a store owner has three possible routes to do the upgrade:
1. Do the upgrade on their own (DIY option);
2. Hire X-Cart Team to perform the upgrade (Professional and Custom options);
3. Hire a 3rd party company to perform the upgrade (DIY option + whatever agreement a store owner comes up with 3rd party).

You can check the detailed description of each option on our web-site [x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

If you have decided to do the XC4 -> XC5 upgrade on your own, follow the steps below:
