The first step is preparation.

You need to make sure that your current server is {% link "compatible with X-Cart 5" ref_19hsx4O9 %}. If not, set up a new server for it or perform the upgrade on your local machine. More info about {% link "how to set up servers for smooth migration" ref_1i0r1QYO %} is available.

Once you decide what server to use for the migration, {% link "install X-Cart 5" ref_VG5mIoLT %} there.

Besides, you may want to check {% link "what data can be migrated" ref_32GoV7A0 %} by the _X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard_ addon and learn about the {% link "advanced settings" ref_1IAKq4cq %} of this addon.
