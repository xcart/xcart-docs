There are some basics that set a foundation for the rest of your shipping. While you can come back and change each of these later on, as you learn more, these are the key decisions and steps that make up your high-level shipping strategy.

* _Your shipping rates and methods_

  Will you offer free or flat-rate shipping to absorb some or all of the cost or will you pass the full cost of shipping on to your customers? If the later, will you use real-time shipping carriers like UPS, CanadaPost, DHL or whatever or will you use custom shiping rates, that you can control yourself?

* _Product weights_

  To streamline the process, measure and update the weight of each product you sell. Having that information set up will help you get a good sense of your total costs, and pass along accurate prices to your customers.

* _Effective ecommerce shipping strategy_

  Before you can ship products, you’ll first need to decide your pricing strategy for shipping. There are several common methods, but your choice should always be informed by the underlying financials of your business.

  X-Cart is integrated with the real-time shipping carriers as well as suppotrs custom shipping rates that you can set up and control yourself. Moreover you can combine both ways for more profit if necessary. Below you'll find a guide on the basic shipping configuration and set-up as well as some usecases that may be helpful to understand the overall shipping opportunities.
