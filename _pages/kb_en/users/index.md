An online store is no store without users. X-Cart has 2 main types of user accounts available in all X-Cart editions - administrators (aka admins) and customers. 

Store admins are the user(s) who configure, maintain, and run the store. There can be either one or several admins in the same store. If necessary admins can be divided into groups and differentiated by roles they are privileged to perform. Store admins can also act as any registered user (being it another admin or a registered customer) if required. 

Customers are the regular store visitors or buyers. Customers can be registered and anonymous. A registered customer is a buyer who saved the e-mail used to make an order and thus created an account in your store this way. An anonymous customer is a buyer who ordered anything in your store without saving the e-mail used to place the order. This doesn't mean that X-Cart doesn't create a customer account for anonymous buyers at all, in fact, it does and saves all the info the buyer provided for possible future references. If such a buyer decides to register an account with the e-mail used to place orders previously a store admin can join the newly registered customer account with the existing records to save the history of purchases for this buyer. Registered customers can be differenciated and privileged (via discounted prices, wholesale offers, extended payment an/or shipping choice, etc.) by memberships they are assigned to.

X-Cart also allows to create separate accounts for sellers (aka vendors) in case you are running an e-mall or a marketplace based on {% link "X-Cart Multivendor edition" ref_4ahg5FLK %}. Vendors are less privileged than the store admins and have a limited access to the store (they mainly manage the products they own).
