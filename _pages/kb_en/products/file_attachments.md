Sometimes it's necessary to expand the regular products description with a file attachment to provide your customers with a manual if you are selling e.g. household appliances or with a detailed programm description if you are selling courses, whatever.

You can do this using the _Attachments_ tab on the Product details page (**Catalog** -> **Products** section).
