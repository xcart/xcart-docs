Promotional blocks enable you to enhance the default presentation of your products on the storefront and engage customers in viewing more products than they initially intended. 

The blocks _New Arrivals_, _Comming Soon_, _Bestsellers_ or _Recently Viewed_ can be used to help your customers to navigate through your catalog better. Stickers displayed on the products in such blocks - with messages like "10% off","30% less" (than the market price) or any custom text - are sure to gain additional customers' attention. For more info on this, see the following sections:
