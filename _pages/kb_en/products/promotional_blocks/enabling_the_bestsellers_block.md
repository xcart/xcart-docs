You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to showcase the most popular products (the ones that have been purchased at your store the most often) in a separate section where your store visitors will be more likely to see them. This feature is available through the use of the **Bestsellers** addon by X-Cart team. To use the feature, make sure this addon is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_0fGEpvrh %} in your store.

Your best selling products are displayed on a separate store page available via the **Hot deals** menu:
![bestsellers_page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers_page.png)

There is also a "Bestsellers" block in the central area of your store site closer to the page bottom:
![bestsellers3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers3.png)
You can find it on the Home page as well as on category pages.

If necessary, it is possible to move the block to a different location using the Layout Editor in the [Webmaster Mode](https://devs.x-cart.com/webinars_and_video_tutorials/using_webmaster_mode_in_x-cart_5.html).

The products for the "Bestsellers" block are selected automatically based on your store's product sales statistics. You specify the maximum number of products that can be shown within the block, and X-Cart populates this block with the specified number of products choosing the ones that have been purchased by your customers the most often. 

On category pages, the block provides a list of category bestsellers; on the Home page, the block contents is formed based on the overall site sales statistics using the most popular products from different categories.

The maximum number of products that can be shown within the "Bestsellers" block on the Home page and on the category pages can be adjusted as follows:

   1. Use the **Settings** link to access the "Bestsellers" addon settings page.
      ![bestsellers1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers1.png)
      
      The addon settings page looks like the following:
      ![bestsellers2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers2.png)
    
   2. Adjust the number of products as you require. 
    
   3. Save the changes by clicking **Submit**.
