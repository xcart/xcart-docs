When you decide you need to group certain products into a product class, you begin by creating this product class.

To create a new product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & attributes**).
2.  Click the **New product class** button:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719235.png)
    An editable field will appear on a new line in the list of product classes:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719236.png)
3.  Use the new field to enter a name for the new product class. For example, we will create a product class "Plates":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719237.png)
4.  Click **Save changes**:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719238.png)
    The new product class will be saved and added to the product class list:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719239.png)

After a product class has been created, you can assign it to products and, if necessary, {% link "add attributes" ref_kEKoAxJB#adding-product-class-attributes %} for it.

If necessary, you can edit the product class name or delete the product class altogether.
