When some products in your catalog have certain characteristics in common and need to be handled together as a group, it may be a good idea to configure a product class for them. 

Product classes are listed and managed in the **Classes & attributes** section (**Catalog** > **Classes & attributes**) of your store’s Admin area:

![classes-listing.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7bb4uhwg/classes-listing.png)

For each product class, you can see the number of products to which it has been assigned.

The list of attributes for each specific product class can be viewed by clicking the Edit attributes (N) link opposite the product class name.

_In this section:_

*  {% link "Creating Product Classes" ref_6ieZHjOV %}
*  {% link "Assigning Product Classes to Products" ref_4PN1b5la %}
*  {% link "Managing Product Classes" ref_EVqNSaZy %}
