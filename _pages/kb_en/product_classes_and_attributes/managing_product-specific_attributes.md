This page provides information on the following actions with product-specific attributes:

*   [Adding product-specific attributes](#adding-product-specific-attributes);
*   [Viewing a product's list of product-specific attributes](#viewing-a-products-list-of-product-specific-attributes);
*   [Editing product-specific attributes](#editing-product-specific-attributes);
*   [Deleting product-specific attributes](#deleting-product-specific-attributes).

## Adding product-specific attributes 

To add a new attribute at the level of a specific product, follow the instructions below:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product for which you want to add a new attribute, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. We will do this to a product named "Critter Print Melamine Plate 10 inch Set of 4, Orange Cat" (In this example we will add the attribute "Critter print color....Orange" to this product to specify the color of the cat on the plate):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719250.png)
    This will open a page where you can manage attributes for this product. Here you can see two subsections: **Product-Specific** and **Global**. Make sure you are viewing the **Product-Specific **section:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719251.png)
    If you haven't yet added any product-specific attributes for this product, the Product-Specific attributes list will be empty:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719252.png)
2.  Use the **Add attribute** button to add a field for the new attribute. This is where you will specify your attribute name and value(s). 
    X-Cart supports three types of attribute value fields:

    *   Plain field
    *   Textarea
    *   Yes/No

    You must select the type that best suits your needs (For an explanation of the different attribute value field types, see {% link "Managing attribute values" ref_bTfJ9bTS %}). By default, clicking **Add attribute** creates a Plain field. To select a different field type, click on the "down arrow" expandable part of the **Add attribute **button and select the type you require from the drop-down button menu:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719253.png)
3.  The new attribute field will appear on a new line in the Product-Specific attributes list. For the sake of example, the snapshot below demonstrates a newly added Plain field:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719254.png)
4.  Use the field that has been added to specify your attribute's name and value (or, if necessary, multiple values). For the sake of example, we will add the attribute "Critter print color" with the value "Orange":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719255.png)
5.  Click **Save changes**. The attribute will be assigned to the product.
    Now if you check the **Specification** tab on the product details page, you will be able to see the attribute you have added:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/7602459.png)

## Viewing a product's list of product-specific attributes

If a product has any product-specific attributes assigned, you can view their list in the **Product-Specific** section of the **Attributes** tab of the product's details:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719256.png)

## Editing product-specific attributes

Sometimes you may need to edit the name and/or value(s) of an attribute created at the level of a specific product.

You can do it like so:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product whose attribute you need to edit, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. 
2.  Make sure you are viewing the **Product-Specific **section.
3.  In the list of product-specific attributes, locate the attribute you need to edit and make any changes you require:

    *   To edit the attribute name, hover your cursor over it (the **Attribute name** field will become visible), click inside the **Attribute name** field and edit the attribute name as you require. 
    *   To edit the attribute values, edit the **Attribute value** field(s).
4.  Click **Save changes**.

## Deleting product-specific attributes

 Sometimes you may need to delete an attribute created at the level of a specific product.

You can do it like so:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product whose attribute you need to delete, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. 
2.  Make sure you are viewing the **Product-Specific **section.
3.  In the list of product-specific attributes, locate the attribute you need to delete and click on the **Trash** icon opposite its name. The attribute will be marked for deletion.
4.  Click **Save changes**.
